# My portfolio website

This is my portfolio website's github page, it was built with typescript, react and next-js

## Contributors

Currently the only contributor to the project is me (@h8moss) and I plan to keep
it that way, however user u/extraacc16 was gracious enough to submit a mock
design for some parts of the website, which were used extensively throught the
site.
